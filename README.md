# Hi there 👋

I am **Gabriel Valenzuela**, a Computer Engineer with a strong focus on **software engineering**, **cybersecurity**, and **higher education**.

I am currently completing a **Master’s degree in Software Engineering** at **Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP)**, complementing my previous studies with advanced knowledge in systems architecture, formal methods, and secure software development. I also hold a diploma in **Cybersecurity** from **Universidad de Palermo (UP)**.

Professionally, I serve as a **professor of Operating Systems II** and **Algorithms and Data Structures** at **Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC)**, where I specialize in teaching modern operating system concepts, distributed systems, algorithmic thinking, and system-level programming. Concurrently, I work as a **software engineer at [Wazuh](https://www.wazuh.com)**, focusing on the development of high-performance, secure solutions in **C** and **C++** for open-source security platforms.

My academic journey includes a thesis on **Petri Nets**, exploring their applications in modeling and analyzing concurrent systems. In 2022, I had the honor of presenting my research at **Meeting C++**, discussing the relevance of Petri Nets in contemporary software engineering.

Beyond academia and industry, I am deeply committed to fostering technical communities. I am a member of **RUNIC** (*Red Universitaria de Ingeniería en Computación*) and the founder of **[C+rd+ba](https://sites.google.com/view/cppcordoba/inicio)**, an initiative aimed at promoting the C++ ecosystem in Córdoba, Argentina. I regularly deliver technical talks and workshops at conferences, advocating for best practices in software engineering and promoting continuous learning.

In addition, I maintain an active **[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBGCxwHv-q1ztZjUZUa-05A)** where I share educational content related to operating systems, cybersecurity, algorithms, and C++ development, extending my commitment to education beyond the traditional classroom.

My work reflects a strong passion for **building reliable systems**, **mentoring future engineers**, and **contributing to the professional and academic communities**.  
I am open to **academic collaborations**, **technical talks**, **research initiatives**, and **professional engagements** related to **software architecture**, **cybersecurity**, **operating systems**, and **formal methods**.
