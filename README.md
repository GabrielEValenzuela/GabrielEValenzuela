### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gabriel, a computer engineer who's been journeying through the exciting realms of technology and cybersecurity.

Iâ€™m currently completed a diploma in cybersecurity at UP (Universidad de Palermo).

I'm an educator at heart. I teach Operating Systems 2 at UNC, where I help students unravel the intricacies of modern computing systems. When I'm not in the classroom, you'll find me as a dedicated software engineer at [Wazuh](https://www.wazuh.com). My focus? Crafting robust solutions in C and C++.

I thrive on an unending curiosity. Learning is my passion, and I'm constantly exploring new horizons in the ever-evolving tech landscape. My undergraduate thesis delved into the fascinating realm of Petri Nets. These mathematical models provide a unique way to analyze and visualize concurrent systems. In 2022, I had the honor of sharing my expertise at MeetingCpp. I delivered a talk on Petri Nets, exploring their applications and significance in modern computing.

My journey is a testament to the incredible power of merging education, hands-on experience, and an insatiable thirst for knowledge.

Feel free to connectâ€”I'm always up for a chat about the latest tech trends, cybersecurity strategies, or just exchanging ideas on how to keep the fire for learning burning bright!
